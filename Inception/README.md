# Inception Project

This project demonstrates a simple React application setup with a focus on understanding the use of refs, rendering elements, and handling cross-origin requests with CDNs.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the React and ReactDOM libraries via CDN and references the `app.js` script.
- `app.js`: The main JavaScript file that creates and renders React elements.
- `index.css`: A simple CSS file to style the React elements.
- `homework`: A file containing explanations about CDNs and the `crossorigin` attribute.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., VSCode)

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to see the React application in action.

### Explanation

#### What is a CDN and how does it work?

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers that deliver web content to users based on their geographic location. CDNs cache content in multiple locations around the world, reducing latency and improving load times for users. When a user requests a resource, the CDN serves it from the nearest server, ensuring faster delivery.

#### What is the `crossorigin` attribute and what does it mean if I put it in a CDN as a parameter?

The `crossorigin` attribute is used to handle cross-origin requests. When included in a script or link tag, it specifies how the browser should handle requests for resources from a different origin. The attribute can have the following values:

- `anonymous`: The browser sends a request without credentials (cookies, HTTP authentication, and client-side SSL certificates).
- `use-credentials`: The browser sends a request with credentials.

Using the `crossorigin` attribute with a CDN ensures that the browser correctly handles the cross-origin request, allowing the resource to be loaded and used in the web application.
